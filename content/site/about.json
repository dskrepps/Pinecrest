I wanted an interface to search them and show others while at the same time I needed to learn new web technologies, thus this web app was born."

      "body": "Artists having been sharing their battle maps in Reddit communities such as <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/battlemaps\">/r/battlemaps</a>, <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/DnD\">/r/DnD</a>, and <a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/FantasyMaps\">/r/FantasyMaps</a>. Many of these artists do so as an incentive to find more maps and other content by joining their Patreon where you can support them. Using Reddit's JSON API I am only instructing your web browser to display these posts by the original artists directly from Reddit."

      "heading": "Can you add maps I think should be here?",
      "body": "I watch Reddit for hand-drawn maps I like that fit the particular style of the collection. Whether or not a map matching the criteria gets here depends on if I see it and if I have time to put it up."
